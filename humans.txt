	Sophie True -- social director -- @sophietrue
	Thomas Jamrozik -- research and writing

# THANKS

    No one, except for the one guy who answered [Alex's Stack Overflow question][1] about the social icons cutting off. Except for that, we really did this on our own (unless you count MDN, HTML5Boilerplate, Font Awesome, and Twitter Bootstrap in which case, thanks a ton!)
